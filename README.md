> Ruby code linter

![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

This is a basic and simple linter to help you check your ruby code. These are the good and bad it checks on:
#### Respect of CamelCase and namespacing for modules, class and method name
   ** Bad **
   `class myClass`
   ** Good **
   `class MyClass`
#### Respect of syntax for condition and itteration declaration
   ** Bad **
   `ifmycondition` or `myarray .times do {|i| print i}`
   ** Good **
   `if mycondition` or `myarray.times do |i|` or `myarray.times {|i| print i}`
#### Corresponding end for each oppening line
   ** Bad **
   `class MyClass def my_function end` 
   ** Good **
   `class MyClass def my_function end end`
